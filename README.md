## Beyond Crack Detection: Generative AI for Autonomous Infrastructure Inspection Reports üìãüèóÔ∏è

This project focuses on enhancing infrastructure inspection through the integration of deep learning models and generative AI technologies for crack detection and report generation. The inspection process primarily involves two main components: crack detection and report generation.

### Crack Detection
Crack detection is achieved through a deep learning model inspired by GoogleNet architecture. This model is trained on a dataset of annotated crack images to accurately identify and classify cracks present in the structures. The trained model is capable of detecting cracks with high accuracy, aiding in the early identification of potential structural issues.

### Report Generation
The report generation process utilizes various technologies to create comprehensive inspection reports. Firstly, a Visual Question Answering (VQA) model is employed to gather answers related to detected cracks and other visual aspects from the inspection data. Additionally, depth camera data is utilized to provide further insights into the structural condition. Finally, a Language Model (LM) is used to generate detailed inspection reports in Markdown format.
The generated reports are presented to users through a Streamlit web page interface, offering an intuitive and accessible platform for viewing inspection findings and recommendations.
